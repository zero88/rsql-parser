== 2.2.0 (2022-01-10)

* Added `~`(`~=`, `=~`, `=lk=`) as `Like` operator and `!~`(`=nk=`) as `Not Like` operator.

== 2.1.0 (2014-02-07)

* Added `\` (backslash) as an escape character inside a quoted argument (requested in {issue-uri}/#7[#7]).

== 2.0.0 (2014-10-23)

* Simplified AST; node per operator replaced with just ComparisonNode.
* Simplified support for custom operators; the RSQLNodesFactory is no longer needed.
* The RSQLParserException changed to inherit from the RuntimeException.
* Added withSelector/withArguments/withChildren methods to the AST nodes.
* Tests improved.

== 2.0.M1 (2014-03-20)

* JavaCC grammar, all the code and tests completely rewritten.
* Proper AST with enhanced Visitor pattern implemented.
* Introduced support for enhancing parser with custom FIQL-like operators.

* Added `=in=` and `=out=` operators, arguments group.
* FIQL operators syntax relaxed; any `=[a-z]*=` is parsed as an operator and validation is done in RSQLNodesFactory.
  This allows to add custom operators.

* Dropped an alternative notation for equal operator; only pair equal characters (`==`) are allowed!
